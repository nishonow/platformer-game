## ✨ Overview
A 2D platformer built with C++ and raylib. Navigate tile-based levels, collect coins and keys, avoid traps, and reach the exit to advance. The game includes multiple levels, lives, sound effects, and a victory screen.

## 🎮 Features
- 5 handcrafted levels with increasing difficulty
- Coins, keys, and exits with score-based progression
- Traps that reduce lives and reset progress
- Menu, pause, how-to-play, and victory screens
- Animated sprites and background music

## 🕹️ Controls
- Move: Arrow keys or WASD
- Jump: Up / W / Space
- Start: Enter
- Pause/Resume: Esc
- How to Play: H
- Back to Menu (from pause): M
- Back (from help screen): B

## 🧩 Gameplay Rules
- Collect coins to increase score.
- Collect keys for a bonus and an extra life.
- Reach the exit with enough score to unlock the next level.
- Touching traps reduces lives; at 0 lives, the game ends.

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- C++17
- raylib (graphics, input, audio)
- CMake + vcpkg (dependencies)

## ⚙️ Build & Run (Windows)
